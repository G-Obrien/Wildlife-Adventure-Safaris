<h5>THE FLIP SIDE</h5>
<p>
Though inbreeding is discouraged, over the years, it has been used by animal
breeders to enhance positive traits in a breed. Through inbreeding, breeder
are able to produce uniform predictable offspring. <br> Breeders also use the same   
technique to make unwanted genes that carry undesirable traits prominent so 
that they can be eliminated for future generations of the breed.
This, however, is the preserve of professional breeders who have access to modern
technology. The average farmer is not advised to carry out such exercises on their 
own.

<h6>Prevention of inbreeding</h6>
<p>
<b>* </b> In the long term the average additive relationship in the population determines the 
constrained inbreeding. Therefore prevention of (forced) inbreeding highly depends of 
the methods to manage relationships among animals in the population. In commercial 
breeding populations a lot of effort is applied to manage this, although random effects 
(e.g. a selected animal produces no offspring) might disturb the intentions of the mating 
program. <br> 
<b>* </b> In less controlled breeding programs it is very difficult to realize management 
programs to control relatedness. Then it is wise to give breeders inside in the implications
of mating relatives and to stimulate individual breeders to apply matings that all together
have a favourable effect on the average additive relationship. A mating advice (which sires
can be mated to this individual dam to minimise the increase in relationship in the 
population) might be of great help.

<h5>WAYS TO CONTROL INBREEDING</h5>
<p>
    <b>* </b>  One of the easiest ways to avoid inbreeding is by ensuring that animals are sourced 
   from diverse populations within the breed. Buying all your stock from the same farm
   where mating may not be controlled puts you at the risk of having closely related animals. <br>
      <b>* </b> It is important that you scrutinise the records of the animal breeder to understand 
   the ancestry of the animal. Most good breeders should avail such records and actually
   use them as a marketing tool. <br>
   <img src="../img/800by600/Gorilas12.png" alt="cross-breeding" class="dest-img"><br>
      <b>* </b> It is difficult to establish the genetic makeup of animals with no pedigree records. This 
   also makes it difficult to predict their performance. <br>
     <b>* </b>  A farmer should also ensure that mating within the herd or flock is controlled. Allow only 
   certain males to mate with specific unrelated females. <br>
      <b>* </b> Keeping records of this will manage future matings of their offspring. It is always advisable 
   to introduce unrelated animals from other farms to boost the genetic quality of your herd.<br>
   <img src="../img/800by600/Hipos.png" alt="hipos" class="dest-img"><br>
   <b>* </b> The most important thing in this simple but important exercise is to maintain accurate and 
    complete records.

<h4>About Rwanda Safaris </h4>
<h5>WHY IS INBREEDING DISCOURAGED?</h5>
<p>
    <b>* </b>   Inbreeding is associated with reduced performance of the offspring. Repeated mating of 
   closely related animals produces progenies that are inferior to their ancestors in terms
    of the quality and quantity of their output (milk, meat and eggs, among others). <br>
     <b>* </b>  This is mainly due to lack of variety in the gene pool and possible erosion of the good 
   traits that the ancestors had. Low productivity translates to low earnings for the farmer.<br>
   <img src="../img/800by600/Tour1.png" alt="Habitat" class="dest-img"><br>
      <b>* </b> Inbreeding has also been associated with higher mortality rates, lower growth rates, higher 
   frequency of hereditary abnormalities and inherited disease conditions in the offspring than
    in the forebears.<br>
    <img src="../img/800by600/Elephants.png" alt="Elephants" class="dest-img">
      <b>* </b> Additionally, in case of certain weaknesses or abnormalities in the ancestors, these will 
   become more pronounced in their offspring when they repeatedly reproduce amongst themselves.
    Inbred animals also tend to exhibit loss of the vigour associated with a particular breed. <br>
     <b>* </b> Inbreeding is most likely to happen when a farmer keeps a few animals in an enclosed area 
   where they randomly mate. Lack of mating partners from other populations or absence of 
   artificial insemination (AI) services increases the chances of animals mating with their
    parents, siblings and other ‘close relatives’.
